      "For me technology is not a way to digitize the world or put humans in a world of zeros and ones, I don't see technology as an end in itself at all. It's just a means to removing frictions and get you useful information. Technology for technology's sake means absolutely nothing to me. Technology on the other hand that reveals and supports real life activities is a good thing. I used to say this a lot and have it for years, but technology with humanity is what I'm thinking about. Technology is less important than innovation.",
