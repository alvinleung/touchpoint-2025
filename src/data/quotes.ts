    quote:
      "For me technology is not a way to digitize the world or put humans in a world of zeros and ones, I don't see technology as an end in itself at all. It's just a means to removing frictions and get you useful information. Technology for technology's sake means absolutely nothing to me. Technology on the other hand that reveals and supports real life activities is a good thing. I used to say this a lot and have it for years, but technology with humanity is what I'm thinking about. Technology is less important than innovation.",

    quote: "We don’t have time to get all emotional about our failures, all we see is the challenge before us to get it right, and not make that mistake again. And eventually, if you do that enough: it WILL start to become easy, or easier.",

    quote: "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask… for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.",

    quote: "Designing is first off about THINKING. Before you design anything, think first.",
    author: "Russell Taylor",
  },
  {
    quote: "As you design: remember this bigger picture. And you continue as a designer, be in the practice of continuing to ask: what is design? What is good design? And, why do we design? As well as the seemingly easier question of whom are we designing for. Because if we don’t, I fear that “design” as UX design, will lose its very soul.",

    quote: "Do not think of your faults, still less the faults of others; look for what is good and strong, and try to imitate it. Your faults will drop off, like dead leaves, when their time comes.",

  {
    quote: "Isn’t all design centered around users? No. In fact, the forces that drive product development range from short-term economic interests of manufacturers to the expressive or theoretical intent of designers, to a community’s entrenched habits and customs. Sometimes things look the way they do because that’s the cheapest and fastest way to make them, sometimes because that’s the way things have always been done.",

    quote: "You probably have heard the saying, 'it's important to care, but be careful of caring too much'.  When we over-invest, our egos can get in the way. and, as our work is so collective, we simply cannot let things go there.",
    author: "Russell Taylor",
  },
  {
    quote: "When designers create products, spaces or media they ask along the way how human beings will interact with their work. Engineers start from technology and look for a use for it; business people start with a business proposition and then look for the technology and people. Designers start with people, coming towards a solution from the point of view of people.",

    quote: "IN THE ROOM: we are here to learn, to inspire each other, to inspire ourselves, to be changed by the learning, and what we are learning. The walls of the classroom are for me sacred. When we enter that space, it is a context, worthy of our deep respect, and a container for our hopes, dreams, goals and ambitions collectively.",
